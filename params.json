{"name":"Clarity","tagline":"Clarity solves Boggle games.","body":"# Clarity\r\n\r\nClarity is an engine for automatically solving Boggle games.  It was originally written in 2006 in a fit of boredom.  After the C++14 specification was published I set about converting it to C++14, and along the way cleaned it up to the point where it can be used as an example of good programming style and modern C++14 usage.\r\n\r\nEach new version of Clarity adds new features, while leaving some things for interested people to investigate and solve.  In version 1.0 there's a minimal Autotools build environment and source code that builds a library and has an optional unit test.    It appears to work correctly, but the output can sometimes get a little weird -- why is this, and how can it be fixed?\r\n\r\n(Version 1.1 will remedy this.)\r\n\r\nSubsequent development will include a crossplatform GUI for Boggle.
