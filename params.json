{"name":"Clarity","tagline":"Clarity solves Boggle games.","body":"# Clarity\r\n\r\nClarity is an engine for automatically solving Boggle games.  It was originally written in 2006 in a fit of boredom.  After the C++14 specification was published I set about converting it to C++14, and along the way cleaned it up to the point where it can be used as an example of good programming style and modern C++14 usage.\r\n\r\nWe're now in version 1.2.  Further development is unlikely: please consider this a mature library.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
