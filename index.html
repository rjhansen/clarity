<p>Clarity is an engine for automatically solving Boggle games.  It was originally written in 2006 in a fit of boredom.  After the C++14 specification was published I set about converting it to C++14, and along the way cleaned it up to the point where it can be used as an example of good programming style and modern C++14 usage.</p>

<p>Each new version of Clarity adds new features, while leaving some things for interested people to investigate and solve.  In version 1.1 there's a minimal Autotools build environment and source code that builds a library and has an optional unit test. </p>

<p>Subsequent development will include a crossplatform GUI for Boggle.  Watch this space.</p>
